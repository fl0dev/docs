# Workspaces

Workspaces in FL0 are home to all your projects, services and databases. A workspace may represent an organization or a team. When you create a FL0 account, we give you a default Workspace to use.&#x20;

Each Workspace has its own:

1. Users & permissions
2. Billing plan
3. Connection to a Github organization

You can create additional Workspaces in FL0 by following these steps:

1. Click the arrow next to Workspace breadcrumb in the top-left corner of the interface
2. In the dropdown menu, click **New workspace**
3. Give the Workspace a name

### Connecting a Workspace to Github

1. Navigate to the **Workspace settings** tab
2. Select the **Git connections** link on the left
3. Click the **Open Github connection page** button
